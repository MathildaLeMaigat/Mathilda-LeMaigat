Looking for an Internship in FullStack JavaScript || React.js

After working for 10 years in the tourism industry, in hospitality and scuba diving, I decided to take a new step and learn programming! I spent 10 intense weeks improving my knowledges. But I still have a long way to go, that's why I am now looking for an internship for 4 to 6 months as a Web Developper!
